## 🚀 About Me

I build and ship production-ready applications with a strong focus on structure, maintainability, and real-world deployment.

My interests lie at the intersection of application development and systems engineering — particularly Linux, cloud infrastructure, and backend architecture.

Currently preparing for **RHCSA** and deepening my understanding of system administration, automation, and scalable backend design. Working on deployment processes in Azure VMs to bridge the gap between development and production.
